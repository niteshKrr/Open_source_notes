# Variables & Data types

## 1. Variables

A variable is a name that stores a value in memory.

Features :-

- No need to declare type.
- Type is decided automatically (dynamic typing).
- Variable names are case-sensitive.
- Cannot start with numbers.

    ```python
    x = 10
    name = "John"
    pi = 3.14

    ```

## 2. Data Types

Python has several built-in data types.

Numeric Types

- int → whole numbers
- float → decimal numbers
- complex → complex numbers (e.g. 2+3j)

Sequence Types

- str → strings
- list → ordered, mutable
- tuple → ordered, immutable
- range → range of numbers

Mapping Type

- dict → key-value pairs

Set Types

- set, frozenset

Boolean Type

- bool → True/False

```python
a = 10          # int
b = 3.14        # float
c = "Hello"     # str
d = [1, 2, 3]   # list
e = (1, 2, 3)   # tuple
f = {"name": "Tom"}   # dict

```
