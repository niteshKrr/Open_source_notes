**Docker** is an open-source containerization platform by which you can pack your application and all its dependencies into a standardized unit called a **container**. Containers are light in weight which makes them portable and they are isolated from the underlying infrastructure and from each other container. You can run the docker image as a docker container in **any machine** where docker is installed without depending on the **operating system**.
