# Introduction to Kubernetes

## 📌 What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes (K8s) is an **open-source container orchestration platform** that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).


## 🏆 Why Use Kubernetes? (Benefits & Use Cases)
Kubernetes simplifies the management of containerized applications at scale. Here’s why it's widely used:

### ✅ **Key Benefits**
- **Automated Deployment & Scaling –** Deploy and scale applications automatically.
- **Self-Healing –** Restarts failed containers, replaces unhealthy nodes.
- **Load Balancing –** Distributes traffic across multiple containers.
- **Service Discovery –** Helps containers find and communicate with each other.
- **Declarative Configuration –** Uses YAML/JSON files for easy setup.
- **Rolling Updates & Rollbacks –** Deploy new versions with zero downtime.
- **Multi-Cloud & Hybrid Support –** Works across AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.
- **Efficient Resource Management –** Optimizes CPU & memory usage for cost efficiency.

### 🌎 **Use Cases**
- **Microservices Architecture** - Manages multiple services efficiently.
- **CI/CD Pipelines** - Automates software deployment with tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions.
- **Machine Learning (ML) Workloads** - Supports AI/ML training & inference pipelines.
- **Multi-Cloud Deployments** - Runs applications across AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.
- **Edge Computing & IoT** - Deploys workloads close to the users.
- **Big Data & Analytics** - Orchestrates large-scale data processing.
