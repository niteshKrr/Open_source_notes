**Linux** is a free, open-source operating system (OS) that is based on the **Unix family**. Unlike Windows or macOS, which are owned and controlled by a specific person, company, or organization, Linux is developed and maintained by a global community of developers. The Linux kernel, originally created by Linus Torvalds in 1991, serves as the core of the OS, managing hardware and system resources.
